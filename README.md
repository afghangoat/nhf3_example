# Film storage - C++

An example project which I made for demonstrating C++ coding for my students. It is a film store which is capable of storing, reading and finding films from files. It also features dynamic memory management, metaprogramming features, demonstration of STD functions and classes, tests and makefile.

## Usage

Run:
`make`
`./main`
